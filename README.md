# ColorWorld
This is a work in progress to adapt Jean-NoÃ«l work to ESP8266 platform.

The framework used here is called Sming (a fork is available in my repo lists).

This framework makes it easy to develop alternatives firmwares in C++ for the ESP8266 and is compatible with most sensors libraries already available for the Arduino platform.

Original idea seen here : https://www.ootsidebox.fr/portfolio/color-the-world-23/
